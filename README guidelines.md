We are happy to announce the **#SaveZakar** hackathon in collaboration with Streamlit & Supabase!
The hackathon will take place from July 31st to August 7th!
Submit your application here 👉 ////

**To stay updated on the official start of the Hackathon, please join us on our discord channel and Twitter** 

## Hackathon key details 🔑 ##
* You have a week to create a wildfire early warning system using Memphis.dev and Streamlit.
* You can work on your project and time and submit it via ///
* Submission deadline is Monday, August 7, 2023
* Winners will be announced on ///

## Prizes 🎁 
The prizes will be rewarded in 5 different categories. 

**Main categories**:
* Most creative and impressive visualization
* Most informative visualization
* Most accurate solution
* Most interesting architecture or algorithm

## The challenge 🔥
Zakar Island has been struggling with wildfires in the last few years, taking human and animal lives. The fires also destroy homes and agricultural and industrial crops and cause famines. To aid citizens, the government installed temperature sensors. Your task is to develop software that uses temperature readings and social media messages to detect wildfires before they spread. 

Read more on the data sensors and the scenario here 👉 [About the scenario.md](https://github.com/memphisdev/savezakar/blob/main/About%20the%20scenario.md) 

## Submission 🏁
* Submit your project via ////
* Please use this template and **#SaveZakar** to submit your project.
* If please to be included in the visualization categories, please Make sure to add a Streamlit link to your submission.

## Some examples 😎
Please feel free to approach this problem however you want. We'd love to see your creative solutions!
If you need help getting started, we came up with several ideas 💡:

Idea #1: A dashboard that visualizes the geographic distributions of the temperature readings, tweets, and fire notifications.

Idea #2: Use a Jupyter Notebook to apply statistical outlier detection techniques to the temperature data.

Idea #3: Train and apply machine learning models for outlier and anomaly detection to the temperature data.

Idea #4: Ingesting the data into Elasticsearch and using its anomaly detection techniques.

Idea #5: Using text embedding models like those from HuggingFace to convert the tweets into vectors and perform clustering or similar to identify outliers.

Idea #6: Create a text classifier for the tweet data to identify fire-related tweets.
