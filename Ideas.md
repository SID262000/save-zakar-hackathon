You can approach this problem however you want.  We'd love to see your creative solutions!  
If you need help getting started, we came up with several ideas:

**Idea #1**: A dashboard that visualizes the geographic distributions of the temperature readings, tweets, and fire notifications.

**Idea #2**: Use a Jupyter Notebook to apply statistical outlier detection techniques to the temperature data.

**Idea #3**: Train and apply machine learning models for outlier and anomaly detection to the temperature data.

**Idea #4**: Ingesting the data into Elasticsearch and using its anomaly detection techniques.

**Idea #5**: Using text embedding models like those from HuggingFace to convert the tweets into vectors and perform clustering or similar to identify outliers.

**Idea #6**: Create a text classifier for the tweet data to identify fire-related tweets.
