A fictional island nation named Zakar is suffering from wildfires.<br>
Let's help them build an early warning system and save lives and earth!

# üî• Save Zakar Hackathon
In collaboration with [Streamlit](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit) & [Supabase](https://github.com/supabase),<br>
we are happy to announce Memphis #1 hackathon **#SaveZakar**!<br>

## The story
Wildfires wreak havoc every year.<br>
They take human and animal lives. They destroy agricultural and industrial crops and cause famines.<br>
They damage the environment, contribute to global warming, and generate smoke that pollutes the air.<br>
Their overall impact runs into billions of dollars and includes incalculable harm to people and animals.<br>
<br>
In this hackathon, you are going to build a wildfire early warning system for the fictional island nation of Zakar.

## üîë  Hackathon key information 
* There are two types of potential submitted projects: early warning system and data visualization.
* You have a week to create one or more of the above projects using a prebuilt sensor system and data,<br> Memphis.dev, and Streamlit.
* The submission deadline is Monday, August 7, 2023.
* The submission can take place at any time during this week.
* The winners will be announced on August 21, 2023.

##  üî• The challenge
Zakar Island has been struggling with wildfires in the last few years, taking human and animal lives. The fires also destroy homes and agricultural and industrial crops and cause famines.

Zakar's current fire notification system only sends alerts 3 days after a fire has occurred. That's not enough time to intervene to prevent a fire from spreading or evacuate people. To aid the citizens, the government installed temperature sensors and hired you.<br> 

**Your task is to develop software that uses temperature readings and social media messages to detect wildfires before they spread and generate early-warning alerts.**

Read more on the data that you will work with and the scenario [here](https://github.com/memphisdev/savezakar/blob/main/scenario.md) üëà

## Getting Started - Step 1 - Setting up the environment
To get started with the hackathon, follow these steps:

1. Sign up at the hackathon [main page](https://hackathon.memphis.dev). 
1. Create a [Memphis Cloud](https://cloud.memphis.dev/) account.<br> * After account creation head to the users page and create a new client-type user.<br> * Make sure to save the credentials, you will need them in step 5.
   
![Group 1000002297 (1)](https://github.com/memphisdev/save-zakar-hackathon/assets/107035359/974fc81a-36f5-4566-9c2f-45abe564112d)


1. Fork this repo.
1. Clone your forked repository from GitHub.
1. Run the hackathon setup script.<br>  Three stations (`zakar-tweets`, `zakar-temperature-readings`, and `zakar-fire-alerts`) will
   be created and populated with data.
   
   ```bash
   $ python3 -m venv venv
   $ source venv/bin/activate
   $ pip install -r requirements.txt
   $ python3 setup_memphis.py --host <memphis_hostname> --username <client_type_username> --password <client_type_password> --account-id <memphis_account_id>
   ```
For step 2, head [here](https://github.com/memphisdev/save-zakar-hackathon/blob/main/scenario.md#getting-started---part-2---choose-a-path).

## The Data
You will get access to messages in real-time from Memphis.dev stations using one of the Memphis.dev client SDKs.

Temperature readings are available from the `zakar-temperature-readings` station and look like so:

```json
 {
  "geospatial_x": 4,
  "geospatial_y": 5,
  "temperature": 80.2,
  "day": 23
}
```

Micro-blog posts are available from the `zakar-tweets` station and look like so:

```json
{
  "day": 728,
  "geospatial_x": 4,
  "geospatial_y": 5,
  "text": "Its gettin hot in here (so hot). I am gettin so hot, I wanna take my clothes off"
}
```

Notifications of past wildfire events are available from the `zakar-fire-alerts` station and look like so:
```json
{
  "event_day": 527,
  "notification_day": 530,
  "geospatial_x": 4,
  "geospatial_y": 5
}
```

## üòé Some Project Ideas
Please feel free to approach this problem however you want. We'd love to see your creative solutions!<br>
If you need help getting started, we came up with several ideas üí°:

* **Idea #1:** Create a [Streamlit](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit) dashboard that visualizes the geographic distributions of the temperature readings, tweets, and fire alerts.
* **Idea #2:** Use a Jupyter Notebook to apply statistical outlier detection techniques to the temperature or<br> tweet data.
* **Idea #3**: Train and apply machine learning models for outlier and anomaly detection to the temperature<br> or tweet data.
* **Idea #4:** Ingest the data into Elasticsearch and using its anomaly detection techniques.
* **Idea #5:** Using text embedding models like those from HuggingFace to convert the tweets into vectors<br> and perform clustering or similar to identify outliers.
* **Idea #6:** Create a text classifier for the tweet data to identify fire-related tweets.

## üèÅ Submission
1. Ensure your project is licensed under one of the following: MIT, Apache Software License v2, BSD-2, BSD-3, or Creative Commons.
2. If you are creating an early warning system, have your system generate messages of the following form and send them to a station
  named `zakar-fire-predictions`:
  ```json
  {
    "event_day": 527,
    "geospatial_x": 4,
    "geospatial_y": 5
  }
  ```
3. To submit your project please open an issue in this repo and follow the instructions. 
4. Create a pull request against the original repository with your project.
5. Finally submit your project via the following [form](https://forms.gle/Hkmk1aLv9FvrZox98).
